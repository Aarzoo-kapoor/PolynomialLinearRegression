# PolynomialLinearRegression
After learning simple linear regression model and multiple linear regression model, let's dive into polynomial linear regression which is a special case of simple linear regression and polynomial linear regression is a linear model because, despite involving polynomial terms (like x,x^2,x^3,etc.), it is linear in the coefficients (parameters) rather than the variables themselves meaning the core idea is that linear models are defined by their linearity in parameters (coefficients), not the form of the variables. Here we have taken dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirajdeepbhandari/polynomial-regression showcasing Ice Cream Sales and Temperature Dataset.

Overview

This dataset captures the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. It serves as a practical example for understanding and implementing polynomial regression, a powerful technique for modeling nonlinear relationships in data. By analyzing this dataset, you can explore how variations in temperature affect ice cream sales and build predictive models.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

Temperature (Â°C): The average daily temperature.

Ice Cream Sales (USD): The total daily sales revenue from ice cream.

Data Format

The dataset is stored in a CSV file with the following structure.

Applications

Polynomial Regression Modeling: Understand and predict the relationship between temperature and sales.

Data Visualization: Plotting the sales against temperature to visualize the trend and curve.
