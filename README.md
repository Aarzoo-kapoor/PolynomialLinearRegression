# PolynomialLinearRegression
After learning simple linear regression model and multiple linear regression model, let's dive into polynomial linear regression which is a special case of simple linear regression and polynomial linear regression is a linear model because, despite involving polynomial terms (like x,x^2,x^3,etc.), it is linear in the coefficients (parameters) rather than the variables themselves meaning the core idea is that linear models are defined by their linearity in parameters (coefficients), not the form of the variables. Here we have taken dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirajdeepbhandari/polynomial-regression in which the dataset captures the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. It serves as a practical example for understanding and implementing polynomial regression, a powerful technique for modeling nonlinear relationships in data.
